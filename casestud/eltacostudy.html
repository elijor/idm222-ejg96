                For my user interface design class, we were tasked with redesigning an existing website. I chose El Taco because of its great business presence in the community, while it’s current website was lacking visually. My redesign included created mobile, desktop, and tablet versions of the El Taco site, as well as getting feedback from users on how the redeisgn compares to the original.
               </p>
               <p>
                El Taco is a locally owned and operated Mexican-inspired restaurant, serving tacos, burritos, and nachos in the heart of Drexel University’s Campus in Philadelphia. While exploring local businesses, I came across their website and decided it was in need of a redesign.

            Why El Taco?
        </h2>
        <p>
            El Taco plays a large role in the community as a small business and was even chosen by Door Dash to educate and train other minority-run businesses. While their great food has rewarded them with return customers and great reviews online, their website does not reflect all that El Taco offers. For my user interface design class, we were tasked with redesigning an existing website. I chose El Taco because of its great business presence in the community, while it’s current website was visually lacking.

            Original Website
        </h2>
        <p>
            El Taco’s existing site consisted of immensely empty space and haphazardly placed content. This site does not represent El Taco’s story and well-deserved reputation for delicious food.

            Where Does It Need to Improve?
        </h2>
        <h5>
            Consistency
        </h5>
        <img
        src="../imgs/eltaco/consistency.jpg"
        alt="El Taco's menu and homepage displayed with an unequal sign in between them"
        class="caseimg"
        >
        <p>
            The original El Taco website lacked consistency, as most pages didn’t have the same vital information available in a consistent manner. Without internal consistency in design or content availability, users may be faced with an increased cognitive load. This can lead to frustration and users leaving the site, thus losing potential customers.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, the menu page displays a much different color scheme, different typography, and layout compared to the homepage.

            Information Architecture

            >
        </picture>
        <p>
            While the site's information architecture is not lacking as much as its visual design and interface, it could use some improvements, such as a unifying header and footer with consistent contact information.

            Visual Hierarchy

        </picture>
        <section>
        <p>
            Most pages, especially the homepage lack clear visual hierarchy. The user may not know where to look first as there is a strange mashup of font sizes and text color. A more organized and structured approach will give the site much more appeal.
        </p>
        <h5>
            White Space
        </h5>
        <p>
            The homepage seems to drown in whitespace. Finding the balance between content and air to breathe around it is vital to users feeling confident and comfortable with El Taco and their business as a whole.

            User Testing
        </h5>
        <p>
            To understand how to improve the site, I looked through the perspective of the target audience, Philadelphia college students. Since Drexel University students lived in dorms and off campus housing located in close proximity to the restaurant's location, I decided to prioritize that population.

            By instructing users to navigate through the site and asking them questions regarding their opinions on the site's quality. Some of the topics like "search" don't apply to this specific site. This heuristic analysis showed the strengths and weaknesses of the original El Taco's desktop, mobile, and tablet sites. Across all platforms, it is clear that the site lacks attractive and cohesive visual design, accessible and logical navigation, and content quality.

            Goals
        </h2>
        <p>
            From examining the card sort and observing users interact with El Taco’s existing site, I came to the conclusion of the research phase. The result is the redesign goals outlined below.
        </p>
        <h5>
            Update Graphics and Colors
        </h5>
        <p>
            Very subtle color scheme with a pale strong, pale yellow that makes text hard to read and doesn’t match logo. By utilizing a new color palettes, this website could turn its most apparent weakness into its largest strength.
        </p>
        <h5>
            Incorporate Consistent Footer
        </h5>
        <img
        src="../imgs/eltaco/OGeltacofooter.png"
        alt="a footer displaying copyright 2021 el taco llc information"
        class="caseimg maximg"
        >
        <p>
            Lacking footer with simple copyright information and nothing else. This footer could be used to add consistency to every page with relevant information.
        </p>
        <h5>
            Accessible &amp; Efficient Navigation
        </h5>
        <img
        src="../imgs/eltaco/OGeltacoheader.png"
        alt="Five navigation buttons with relatively small font, el tacos logo, and four social media icon links"
        class="caseimg maximg"
        >
        <p>
            The current navigation menu is hard to use, see, and can be replaced with a more efficient menu bar.
