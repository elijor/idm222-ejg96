                        Born and raised in New Jersey, I am currently pursuing higher education in the intersections of UX/UI design, research, and digital media. Currently as a Drexel University undergraduate student, I spend most of my time in Philadelphia, PA. My academic work is focused on user interface design, user experience design and research. In my free time, I like to paint pet portraits, try different food trucks around the city, and give tours around my college campus as a student ambassador!

                    I love to design, create, and learn in no particular order. I utilize my diverse experiences working in education, childcare, food service, and art communications to drive how I problem solve through design. As a user experience designer, I recognize that understanding the user is vital. To understand various, unique user groups, I place myself in different perspectives through research, interviews, and even hands-on experiences. As a creator, I enjoy innovating in a multitude of media forms. Above all, I acquire new knowledge from every project I work on and gain deeper insights to improve my next project.
